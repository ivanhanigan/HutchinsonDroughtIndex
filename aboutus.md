### History

In 2002 Professor Tony McMichael set up the Atmospheric Environment and Health Collaboration at the ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (with CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology, University of Sydney and NSW Health). The team worked on a range of interrelated projects for the next few years that revolved around the influence of climate on human health and wellbeing. A key output was the report McMichael AJ, Woodruff R, Whetton P, Hennessy KJ, Nicholls N, Hales S, Woodward A, and Kjellstrom T. Human Health and Climate Change in Oceania: a Risk Assessment. Commonwealth Department of Health and Aging Australia. 2003. The team searched across many health outcomes with potent causal influences of climatic variables and focused the search for 'low hanging fruit' that might be most easily analysed. Neville Nicholls from the BoM suggested the strongly suspected increased risk of suicide during droughts. Early analysis using inter-annual rainfall variations provided support for the postulated hypothesis that droughts in Southeastern Australia increase suicide risk. Professor Michael F Hutchinson (ANU) recommended the use of The Hutchinson Drought Index (or Drought Severity Index) as the exposure variable instead. This is a climatic drought index that was designed to reflect agricultural droughts using only rainfall data.	In 2008 the Drought, Drying and Rural Regional Mental Health collaboration was initiated which led to the development of this tool to produce the dataset for use as an agriculturally sensitive drought index.
