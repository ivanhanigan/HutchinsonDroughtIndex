The Hutchinson Drought Index

The Hutchinson Drought Index (or Drought Severity Index) is a climatic drought index 
that was designed to reflect agricultural droughts using only rainfall data.

This project includes an R package in the master branch and the documentation on the gh-pages branch.

The index was invented by Professor Mike Hutchinson at the ANU in 1992 and 
this project includes R codes written by Ivan Hanigan to describe the calculations 
and also to download data to play with.

Casual readers will probably want to go straight to Hutchinson's original report
[https://github.com/ivanhanigan/HutchinsonDroughtIndex/blob/master/inst/doc/HutchinsonDroughtIndex-original.pdf](https://github.com/ivanhanigan/HutchinsonDroughtIndex/blob/master/inst/doc/HutchinsonDroughtIndex-original.pdf)

Readers wishing to reproduce the data analysis can do so by running the 'go.r' script
(see the Specification.txt file for explanations of the structure of the code).
